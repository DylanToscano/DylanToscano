### 👋 Presentation

Hi, I’m Dylan Toscano, a Software Developer and Pilot from Argentina, living in Dubai.
I started coding in Lua when I was 13 years old, and since then programming has been one of the hobbies I have a burning passion for.
I have a Technical Highschool diploma as a Software Technician.
In my past I've done my fair share of Lua commissions, but I'm not professionaly employed in IT at the moment... But I'd love to!

Currently embarking in coding proyects for fun. I love programming💻❤️
